## Introduction 
The objective of this project was to simulate an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) that would be able to transfer material to different set of locations. To complete this simulation, Robot Operating System (ROS) Kinetic was utilized as the base environment for simulating an autonomous UGV. This group chose to emulate Clearpath Robotics' 
<a href="https://clearpathrobotics.com/warthog-unmanned-ground-vehicle-robot/">Warthog UGV</a> 
and their 
<a href="http://www.clearpathrobotics.com/assets/guides/melodic/warthog/">online tutorials</a>. 
There were other software toolkits that were utilized for this project, and there will be further explanation of these toolkits.

Clearpath Roboticsâ€™ Warthog UGV was chosen due to its many features that would allow for it to be utilized in moderate weather conditions, max payload of 600 lbs and towing capacity of 1984 lbs. Another aspect that caught the attention of this group, was that it uses a 64-bit version of Ubuntu 16.04 or 18.04 LTS. The Warthog's onboard computer comes with ROS kinetic or melodic distribution preinstalled and configured.

## Installation
The installation process will be discussed in this section for informing the reader with some background. <br/><br/>

<i>1. Virtual Machine and Ubuntu Install</i><br/><br/>

Since the host operating system (OS) for computers utilised were windows, a linux os was needed to employ ROS. This team planned to use the Kinetic Kame ROS distribution. The first step was to download the Oracle Virtualbox for free and install onto respective computers. The next step was to download and install Ubuntu 16.04 LTS to use in the Virtualbox environment. For more information on setting up ubuntu on Virtual box, please refer to the <a href="https://itsfoss.com/install-linux-in-virtualbox/">link</a> provided. 
<br/><br/>

<i>2. Kinetic Kame ROS Distro Install</i><br/><br/>

Once Ubuntu 16.04 LTS is successfully configured into the vitual environment, the next step was to install Kintec Kame ROS distribution by using the terminal. 

```Python
print("yo momma smell bad on sundays")

```
