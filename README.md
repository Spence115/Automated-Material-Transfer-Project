## Summary <br/>
The objective of this project was to simulate an autonomous unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) that would be able to transfer material to different set of locations. To complete this simulation, Robot Operating System (ROS) was utlised as the base environment for simulating an autonomous UGV. This group chose to emulate Clearpath Robotics' 
<a href="https://clearpathrobotics.com/warthog-unmanned-ground-vehicle-robot/">Warthog UGV</a> 
and their 
<a href="http://www.clearpathrobotics.com/assets/guides/melodic/warthog/">online tutorials</a>. 
There were other software toolkits that were utilised for this project, and there willl be further explanation of these toolkits.
