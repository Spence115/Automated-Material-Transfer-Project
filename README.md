## Introduction 
The objective of this project was to simulate an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) that would be able to transfer material to different set of locations. To complete this simulation, Robot Operating System (ROS) Kinetic was utilized as the base environment for simulating an autonomous UGV. This group chose to emulate Clearpath Robotics' 
<a href="https://clearpathrobotics.com/warthog-unmanned-ground-vehicle-robot/">Warthog UGV</a> 
and their 
<a href="http://www.clearpathrobotics.com/assets/guides/melodic/warthog/">online tutorials</a>. 
There were other software toolkits that were utilized for this project, and there will be further explanation of these toolkits.

Clearpath Roboticsâ€™ Warthog UGV was chosen due to its many features that would allow for it to be utilized in moderate weather conditions, max payload of 600 lbs and towing capacity of 1984 lbs. Another aspect that caught the attention of this group, was that it uses a 64-bit version of Ubuntu 16.04 or 18.04 LTS. The Warthog's onboard computer comes with ROS kinetic or melodic distribution preinstalled and configured.
